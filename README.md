**Web3Py V7 Transmuter** is an enterprise-grade, deterministic codemod engine designed to eliminate the friction of upgrading legacy `web3.py` v5/v6 codebases to the new v7 specification.

Unlike naive regex find-and-replace tools that risk breaking your code, this tool utilizes Abstract Syntax Trees (**AST**) via `LibCST` to guarantee **zero false-positives**, context-aware refactoring, and safe in-place modifications.

## ✨ Key Features

- **AST-Driven Determinism**: Safely renames `camelCase` parameters to `snake_case` (e.g., `fromBlock` → `from_block`) strictly within function calls and dictionary keys.
- **Class-Based Middleware Migration**: Rewrites functional middleware injections to the new v7 class-based architecture.
- **Context-Aware Exception Refactoring**: Intelligently scopes and replaces standard exceptions (e.g., `ValueError` → `Web3ValueError`) only within relevant `except` handlers.
- **Smart Import Management**: Automatically injects required v7 exceptions and middleware imports at the safest file header location, strictly avoiding `__future__` and docstring conflicts.
- **Safe Execution Protocol**: The CLI tool automatically detects its own execution context to prevent "digital cannibalism" (self-refactoring).

## 🛠️ Installation & CLI Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `libcst`

### Setup
Clone the repository and install the required AST engine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rawetrip/web3py-v7-transmuter.git
cd web3py-v7-transmuter
pip install libcst
```

### Running the Codemod
You can run the transmuter on a single file or recursively scan an entire project directory.

```bash
# Refactor a single file
python codemod.py ./my_legacy_script.py

# Recursively refactor an entire project directory
python codemod.py /path/to/your/web3/project/
```

## 🤖 Edge Case & AI Intervention Protocol
This deterministic codemod reliably automates **95%** of Web3.py v7 deprecations via strict AST node matching. However, for deep contextual changes (e.g., distinguishing a non-Web3 `app.middlewares` in a Django application from `w3.middlewares`, or complex asynchronous provider promotions), **we strongly recommend utilizing an LLM/AI Agent for a final diff review**. This workflow perfectly marries deterministic AST safety with AI context-awareness.
